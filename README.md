## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learn a little about table. I don't really like it… I think it's too difficult beside what we can now do in CSS.

I also learn a lot about list and how style items. For simple use we have `::marker` and for the `ol` we can use `counters` to have better style. 

### Continued development

I think I need to practice more table and list to know better how to style them. In this exemple, the table is not very responsive, I think there is a serious challenge below this kind of work…
